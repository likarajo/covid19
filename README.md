Analysing COVID19 (Novel Coronavirus) data

## Background

**Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)** is an infectious disease caused by **severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)**. 
The disease was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic.
The covid-19 has huge potential implications and this project is to dive into the available data and gain insights.

*Bias*: Selection bias on confirmed to those tested there is discriminatory forces that determine who gets tested - age, availability, price/demographic, and on. 
These can change with time. Further, countries are investing to make the tests more available which affects the report.
