# Analyzing COVID19 (Novel Coronavirus) data

Viewing data graphically to understand the impact of the Novel Coronavirus country-wise over time and get the big picture with information involving the number of new confirmed cases, deaths and the % increase in the value.

## Background

**Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)** is an infectious disease caused by **severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)**.<br>
The disease was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in the 2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic.
As the COVID-19 has huge potential implications, this project gives a preliminary platform to dive into the available data and gain insights.

## Data

### Source

John Hopkins University CSSE [Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Cases data](https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/): https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

*Bias*: Selection bias on confirmed over those tested, as there are discriminatory forces that determine who gets tested - age, availability, price/demographic, and so on. These factors can change with time. Further, multiple countries are investing heavily to make the tests more available them, which also affects the report.
